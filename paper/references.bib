Following this goal, the Persistent Phylogeny model and the related tree reconstruction problem (the \{PPP\} problem) have been recently introduced: this model allows only one back mutation for each character. The investigation of the combinatorial properties and the complexity of the model is still open: the most important such question is whether the \{PPP\} problem is NP-hard. Here we propose a graph-based approach to the \{PPP\} problem by showing that instances can be represented by colored graphs, while the solutions are obtained by operations on such graphs. Indeed, we give a graph-based characterization of the solutions to the \{PPP\} problem by showing the relationship between certain sequences of graph operations on the instance graphs and traversals of a persistent phylogeny solving these instances. Based on this result and on some combinatorial properties of the instance graphs we are able to give a polynomial time algorithm for a restricted version of the \{PPP\} problem. "

In each phase a maximal set of disjoint minimum length augmenting paths is found, and the existing matching is increased along these paths. Our contribution consists in devising a special way of handling blossoms, which enables an O({\textbar}E{\textbar}) implementation of a phase. In each phase, the algorithm grows Breadth First Search trees at all unmatched vertices. When it detects the presence of a blossom, it does not 'shrink' the blossom immediately. Instead, it delays the shrinking in such a way that the first augmenting path found is of minimum length. Furthermore, it achieves the effect of shrinking a blossom by a special labeling procedure which enables it to find an augmenting path through a blossom quickly.},

	abstract = {Motivation: DNA sequencing of multiple samples from the same tumor provides data to analyze the process of clonal evolution in the population of cells that give rise to a tumor.
Results: We formalize the problem of reconstructing the clonal evolution of a tumor using single-nucleotide mutations as the variant allele frequency (VAF) factorization problem. We derive a combinatorial characterization of the solutions to this problem and show that the problem is NP-complete. We derive an integer linear programming solution to the VAF factorization problem in the case of error-free data and extend this solution to real data with a probabilistic model for errors. The resulting AncesTree algorithm is better able to identify ancestral relationships between individual mutations than existing approaches, particularly in ultra-deep sequencing data when high read counts for mutations yield high confidence VAFs.
Availability and implementation: An implementation of AncesTree is available at: http://compbio.cs.brown.edu/software.

	abstract = {The tree compatibility problem is a problem concerned with evolutionary history construction. For a species set S, an S-labelled tree is a tree T along with a labelling L: S → V(T). The tree compatibility problem asks whether a set T of S-labelled trees, each of which describes the evolution of S, is compatible in the sense that there is a single tree T from which each tree T ∈ T can be derived by a sequence of edge contractions. Polynomial time algorithms for the tree compatibility problem have been known to exist for a long time, with the best being the recent O(n2k) algorithm by Gusfield to determine compatibility of k trees on n species. Recently Gusfield found an O(nk) algorithm for a restricted case of the tree compatibility problem. In this paper, we will present an O(nk) algorithm for the tree compatibility problem, thus achieving linear time. The perfect phylogeny problem is another problem in evolutionary history construction, which has been recently shown to be in P for special cases but NP-complete for the general case. We will show that we can characterize each instance to the perfect phylogeny problem as an instance to the tree compatibility problem, and thus derive an algorithm for the perfect phylogeny problem. Our algorithm is superior to the other algorithms for perfect phylogeny problem for many realistic cases, such as when the species are defined by molecular data such as amino-acid sequences.},

abstract="The perfect phylogeny is an often used model in phylogenetics since it provides an efficient basic procedure for representing the evolution of genomic binary characters in several frameworks, such as for example in haplotype inference. The model, which is conceptually the simplest, is based on the infinite sites assumption, that is no character can mutate more than once in the whole tree. A main open problem regarding the model is finding generalizations that retain the computational tractability of the original model but are more flexible in modeling biological data when the infinite site assumption is violated because of e.g. back mutations. A special case of back mutations that has been considered in the study of the evolution of protein domains (where a domain is acquired and then lost) is persistency, that is the fact that a character is allowed to return back to the ancestral state. In this model characters can be gained and lost at most once. In this paper we consider the computational problem of explaining binary data by the Persistent Perfect Phylogeny model (referred as PPP) and for this purpose we investigate the problem of reconstructing an evolution where some constraints are imposed on the paths of the tree.",

	abstract = {Intra-tumor heterogeneity poses substantial challenges for cancer treatment. A tumor's composition can be deduced by reconstructing its mutational history. Central to current approaches is the infinite sites assumption that every genomic position can only mutate once over the lifetime of a tumor. The validity of this assumption has never been quantitatively assessed. We developed a rigorous statistical framework to test the infinite sites assumption with single-cell sequencing data. Our framework accounts for the high noise and contamination present in such data. We found strong evidence for the same genomic position being mutationally affected multiple times in individual tumors for 11 of 12 single-cell sequencing data sets from a variety of human cancers. Seven cases involved the loss of earlier mutations, five of which occurred at sites unaffected by large-scale genomic deletions. Four cases exhibited a parallel mutation, potentially indicating convergent evolution at the base pair level. Our results refute the general validity of the infinite sites assumption and indicate that more complex models are needed to adequately quantify intra-tumor heterogeneity for more effective cancer treatment.},

	abstract = {Motivation: Intra-tumor heterogeneity presents itself through the evolution of subclones during cancer progression. Although recent research suggests that this heterogeneity has clinical implications, in silico determination of the clonal subpopulations remains a challenge.Results: We address this problem through a novel combinatorial method, named clonality inference in tumors using phylogeny (CITUP), that infers clonal populations and their frequencies while satisfying phylogenetic constraints and is able to exploit data from multiple samples. Using simulated datasets and deep sequencing data from two cancer studies, we show that CITUP predicts clonal frequencies and the underlying phylogeny with high accuracy.Availability and implementation: CITUP is freely available at: http://sourceforge.net/projects/citup/.Contact:cenk@sfu.caSupplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},
