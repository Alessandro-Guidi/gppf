Start the program with:
`still have to do it`


Test versions (/test_versions)
------------------------------
The test versions are versions of the programs that does not outputs all the
informations regarding the clonal matrix, the usage matrix and does not print
a tree of the reconstructed phylogeny. <br>
It instead prints informations useful for testing. In specific it prints a 
**CSV** file with the following informations: <br>
`matrix_name, num_samples, num_mutations, mut_mod, 
clone_used, k, time, total_error, accuracy` <br>
